## Unobtainium

> *“I am Ubik. Before the universe was, I am. I made the suns.
> I made the worlds. I created the lives and the places they inhabit;
> I move them here, I put them there. They go as I say, then do as I tell them.
> I am the word and my name is never spoken, the name which no one knows.
> I am called Ubik, but that is not my name. I am. I shall always be.”* ― Philip K. Dick, Ubik
